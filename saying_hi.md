# Life Log
 
 ￼I have three ideas:￼
 
 1) It's very difficult to learn from things unless I have a record of what happened, given that my memory is poor.
 2. Tracking myself through time is it excellent way to collect the information I need to learn from my successes and mistakes.￼
 
 3.  collecting a lifetime's worth of documents and experiences in one timeline is far more useful to me than dangerous to me.  Knowing who I am, where I am, and what I stand for is far better than trying to hide or conceal In order to fit in.￼
 
 I want software to give me a lifetime timeline.  A Life log.￼
 
 let's go.

We want to write a little javascript command that says hi, waits one second,
and then says bye. We will save it in [teens.js](# "save:")

Greetings are great, right?

    console.log("hi");

Timer is in milliseconds, so 1000. We'll call the function `bye` defined
elsewhere

    setTimeout(bye, 1000);

And now let's define the bye function. For no apparent reason, we use a named
fence block. Hey, maybe we'll get some syntax highlighting!

```js
function bye () {
    console.log("bye");
}


```
